    "# Final Assignment: A morphogical analyzer\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final assignment, you will build and evaluate an algorithm that learns to segment words into their morphemes. That is to say: the algorithm should be able to determine that _unbelievers_ breaks down into _un-_, _believ_, _-er_ and *-s*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm we will use for doing so is an unsupervised learner. An unsupervised learner is a learner that is not given training data with the correct labels or segmentations but works by just analyzing the unlabeled/unsegmented data it receives. The intuition of the model we will work with is the following: if you have word pairs like _unbeliever_ and _unbelievers_, and _book_ and _books_, and _table_ and _tables_, and many more singular--plural pairs, you can (without knowing the language) make the educated guess that _-s_ is a bound morpheme (an affix) in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model starts with a set of Unmodeled words, which is initialized to be the entire vocabulary (all unique words) for a language, as well as a empty Derivation dictionary, which will contain the analyses. The model then (1) finds the pair of affixes (including zero-affixes) that models the highest number of word pairs among the Unmodeled words, and (2) creates entries in a Derivation dictionary with each member of each word pair as the key and its induced stem + affix derivation as the value. In step (3), finally, the words in the word pair are removed from the Unmodeled set, and the resulting stem is added to the Unmodeled set. Let's have a look at an example to see how that all works!\n",
    "\n",
    "## An example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through an example of the algorithm. Suppose we have a set of unmodeled words:\n",
    "\n",
    "`unmodeled = { 'book', 'bookers', 'books', 'booker', 'chair', 'chairs', 'table', 'tables', 'tags' }`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting a list of most likely affixes\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by extracting all possible likely affixes. Let's limit them to be **maximally length 2**. Doing so we find the following suffixes (make sure you understand why they are associated with the numbers -- can you trace the words they come from?):\n",
    "\n",
    "* '' (9x), '-k' (1x), '-ok' (1x), '-s' (5x), '-rs' (2x), '-ks' (1x), '-r' (2x), '-er' (1x), '-ir' (1x), '-le' (1x), '-es' (1x), '-gs' (1x)\n",
    "\n",
    "and the following prefixes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'b-' (4x), 'bo-' (4x), 'c-' (2x), 'ch-' (2x), 't-' (3x), 'ta-' (3x)\n",
    "\n",
    "(note that we only count the empty string as a suffix -- we don't _also_ count it as a prefix)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since comparing all affixes to each other to see how many stems they model together would take too long when using larger vocabularies (the number of comparisons would get too large), we start by extracting a top-$k$ list of affixes, ranked on their **affix score**. We calculate the affix score by multiplying the count of that affix in the vocabulary (on how many words does it occur) by the character length of the affix plus 1. The equation below summarizes the affix score $score$ of an affix $a$:\n",
    "\n",
    "# $score(a) = freq(a) * (len(a)+1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The length modifier is part of the affix score, as longer substrings (like _-ness_) are often less common by themselves, while still being good affixes, versus shorter substrings (like _b-_ in the example above) that may be frequent but that are not good affixes. (Why the +1, you may ask. If we don't add 1, zero-length strings will have a score of 0 no matter their frequency, which is what we want to avoid.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we rank our affixes by their affix score, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'bo-' (12), '-s' (10), 'ta-' (9), '' (9), 'b-' (8), , 'ch-' (6), '-rs' (6), 't-' (6), '-r' (4), 'c-' (4), '-ok' (3),'-ks' (3), '-er' (3), '-ir' (3), '-le' (3), '-es' (3), '-gs' (3), '-k' (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "From this ranked list, we take the list of **most likely affixes**, or the top-$k$ affixes. Here, we only have 19, so there is no great need to cut the list, but if you have thousands of them, you will have to limit the next steps to the top $k$ ranked ones. Let's take the top-18 here just to illustrate the principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'bo-' (12), '-s' (10), 'ta-' (9), '' (9), 'b-' (8), , 'ch-' (6), '-rs' (6), 't-' (6), '-r' (4), 'c-' (4), '-ok' (3), '-rs' (3), '-ks' (3), '-er' (3), '-ir' (3), '-le' (3), '-es' (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the stems per affix\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to find out how many stems overlap for an affix pair, a good first step is to gather the stems per affix. To do so, we will create a dictionary where every affix in the most likely affix list is mapped onto all the stems it models. The stems are the remaining part of the word string after we have taken the affix away. So, for the first four affixes in our list, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{ ('prefix', 'bo') : { 'ok', 'oks', 'oker', 'okers' }\n",
    "   ('suffix', 's')  : { 'book', 'booker', 'chair', 'table', 'tag' }\n",
    "   ('prefix', 'ta') : { 'ble', 'bles', 'gs' }\n",
    "   ('suffix', '')   : { 'book', 'books', 'booker', 'bookers', 'chair', 'chairs', 'table', 'tables', 'tags' } \n",
    "   ...\n",
    "}`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Select the most likely affix pair\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the sets of stems per affix, we can compare pairs of affixes and determine how many overlapping stems they have. From among the four above, we find the following comparisons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'bo-', '-s' have 0 overlapping stems\n",
    "* 'bo-', 'ta-' have 0 overlapping stems\n",
    "* 'bo-', '' have 0 overlapping stems\n",
    "* '-s', 'ta-' have 0 overlapping stems\n",
    "* '-s', '' have 4 overlapping stems: { 'book', 'booker', 'chair', 'table' }\n",
    "\n",
    "Other affix pairs with overlapping stems are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* '-s', '-er' have 1 overlapping stem: { 'book' }\n",
    "* '', '-er' have 1 overlapping stem: { 'book' }\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the **most likely affix pair** to be that pair that has __the most shared stems__. In this case, that's the pair of `('suffix', '')` and `('suffix', 's')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding the derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We determined that the pair of `('suffix', '')` and `('suffix', 's')` is the most likely affix in the language. What we do next, is add the analysis of each of the stems that this pair models to the dictionary of derived forms. That is: we add a key that is the full word (stem combined with affix) and assign to that key the value which is a pair of the stem and the affix. So, whereas `derived` was empty before, now it contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{ 'book'    : ('book', ('suffix', '')),\n",
    "  'books'   : ('book', ('suffix', 's')),\n",
    "  'booker'  : ('booker', ('suffix', '')),\n",
    "  'bookers' : ('booker', ('suffix', 's')), \n",
    "  'chair'   : ('chair', ('suffix', '')),\n",
    "  'chairs'  : ('chair', ('suffix', 's')), \n",
    "  'table'   : ('table', ('suffix', '')),\n",
    "  'tables'  : ('table', ('suffix', 's')) }`\n",
    "\n",
    "This dictionary will allow us to later look up a word's analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Replacing the modeled words in unmodeled\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we remove the modeled words from the set of Unmodeled words (after all, they are no longer unmodeled), and add the stems (which may still need to be analyzed further).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stepwise, this works as follows. For the affix pair `('suffix', '')` and `('suffix', 's')`, we find 8 words modeled by the pair (the ones added to the derivation dictionary in the previous step). Removing these words from `unmodeled` yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "`unmodeled = { 'tags' }`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, adding the 4 stems (which happen to be identical to some of the removed words, but that's not necessarily the case) yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "`unmodeled = { 'book', 'booker', 'chair', 'table', 'tags' }`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Back to the top\n",
    "\n",
    "And once we've done this, we go back to the step where we get the most likely affix list (from the _updated_ list of Unmodeled words and again extract the most likely affix pair, add it to the derivation dictionary and update the unmodeled words. We repeat this procedure $n$ times in total, where we can set $n$ to be any value between 1 and infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next most likely affix pair for our new list of unmodeled words will be `('suffix', 'er')`, `('suffix', '')`, modeling _book_. We update the derivation dictionary so that 'booker' now is mapped onto 'book' and ('suffix', 'er'). This effectively allows us to find the full derivation for a word like _bookers_: if we give it to the derivation dictionary, we find 'booker' and ('suffix', 's') associated with it. If we then look up the \"stem\" in the derivation dictionary again, we find that it maps onto 'book' and ('suffix', 'er'). So, we know that _bookers_ should be analysed as 'book' + ('suffix', 'er') + ('suffix', 's').\n",

    "\n",
    "Begin by creating a function that takes a word and a parameter specifying the maximum affix length as its parameters and extracts all the potential affixes that are part of the word. That is: for a word like _bookings_ and a maximum affix length of 3, you want the function to return a list of affixes as below:\n",

    "\n",
    "One crucial point is that we **only extract the zero-affix once**. We assume that every word always has a zero-affix, which makes it alternate with non-zero-affixes. **We assume that the zero affix is a suffix**. That is: every word always returns `('suffix', '')` as one of its affixes, but not `('prefix', '')`.

After I checked `pow` in the dictionary, I think the reason for this to happen is the function is treating `pow` as the stem, and `er` as the suffix. It can not recognize `power` as an individual word. One possible way to improve this is to use the NLTK Classifier to read the same word for a few times until it can recognize the word correctly. So that the function can treat `pow` and `power` differently by their meanings."

Use techniques such as the extraction of morphological families, as well as the on-screen print-out of the `learn_morphology` function. Use the Wikipedia page to see if you can determine what the affixes are (are they case markers, or tense-aspect-modality markers, or gender, or evidentiality, or ...).  Leave the code you use for the exploration up so I can see it. Use the text cell at the very bottom to describe your findings. Include discussion of the affixes you failed to find in your description."

    "The language I am assigned to analyze is Basque. After collecting from the txt file, the word I choose from  `words` is `'aberastuak'`. When I parse it into affixes and stem, the result shows it contains an empty suffix `''` and a suffix `'ak'`. And the stem here is `'aberastu'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I check from the google translate, both the word `'aberastuak'` and the stem `'aberastu'` are translated to be the verb `'enriched'` in English. So my first observation here is the suffix `-ak` doesn't change the tense of the verb. From Wikipedia, we know there are three arguments that are relate to verbs of Basque, which are subject, direct object and indirect object. And the `-ak` only show up in absolutive and ergative cases, corresponding to the finding we have for the verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I translate from `'enrich'` as a possible stem from English, the word in Basque becomes `'aberastu'`, with the origal Basque word `'aberastuak'` to be one of the derivations (Google Translate). As a result, we can use machine translation bidirectionally between English and Basque, with a certain level of limitation by further research to find out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, I try `-ko` within the word `'adierazteko'`. According to Wikipedia, the suffix here functions as the case forms to the word adjective. For the suffix `-aren` within the word `'aberatsaren'`, it is one of the possesive genitive in the language. For the suffix `-ari` within the word `'adierazteari'`, it is the dative suffix case in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, I found most of the suffixes from the `derived` dictionary are consistent with the `parsed_word` and the explanation from the Wikipedia page of Basque grammar.\n",
